  # dwm - dynamic window manager
  ### dwm is an extremely ***fast***, ***small***, and ***dynamic*** window manager for X.

---
This is my **HEAVILY MODIFIED** version of dwm. It is based on the original [suckless.org](https://dwm.suckless.org/) dwm window manager but includes a number of patches and customizations to make it more user friendly and functional out of the box.

## 📋 Install
This guide assumes your system has the latest updates before going ahead with the installation on a Arch Linux based system.

1. Launch Linutil Project with the command:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://christitus.com/linux | sh
    ```

2. Enable Multi-Selection with key `v` and select `dwm`, `rofi`, `bash prompt`, and `ghostty` from the list.
  _Note: You can also select other packages as per your requirement._
3. Press `Enter` to start the installation. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

> [!TIP]
> - By default new terminals are opened by using the keyboard shortcut of <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> while rofi is started using <kbd>SUPER</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>
> - Check `config.h` for the keybindings, and change them according to your preference.
